# Data-Driven Housing Insights: Understanding USA Real Estate

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the USA Housing Dataset, exploring the relationship between socio-economic factors and housing prices. The primary goal is to identify key variables that influence real estate values and set the foundation for developing predictive models. The dataset comprises the following features: **Avg. Area Income** (the average income of residents in the area), **Avg. Area House Age** (the average age of houses in the area), **Avg. Area Number of Rooms** (the average number of rooms per house), **Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms** (the average number of bedrooms per house), **Area Population** (the population of the area), and **Price** (the target variable representing house prices).

Essential Python libraries used for data manipulation and visualization include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The code snippet below imports these libraries and sets up inline plotting:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

%matplotlib inline
```

The dataset is loaded using `pd.read_csv()`, and a correlation heatmap is generated to visualize the relationships between variables, which helps identify features that have a stronger impact on the target variable (Price):

```python
housing_data = pd.read_csv('USAHousing.csv')
corr_matrix = housing_data.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True)
plt.show()
```

For model development, the predictors selected are **Avg. Area Income**, **Avg. Area House Age**, **Avg. Area Number of Rooms**, **Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms**, and **Area Population**, with **Price** as the target variable. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets to ensure the predictive model is robust and generalizable:

```python
X = housing_data[['Avg. Area Income', 'Avg. Area House Age', 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms', 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms', 'Area Population']]
y = housing_data['Price']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Next steps include training a predictive model (such as linear regression) to estimate housing prices, evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, and optimizing the model with more advanced algorithms and parameter tuning. This analysis lays the groundwork for understanding the interplay between socio-economic factors and housing prices, ultimately aiming to build robust predictive models for the USA housing market.
