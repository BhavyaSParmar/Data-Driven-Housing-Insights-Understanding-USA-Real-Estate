# Data-Driven-Housing-Insights-Understanding-USA-Real-Estate
This Jupyter notebook provides an analysis of the USA Housing Dataset. The purpose of this analysis is to explore the relationship between various socio-economic factors and housing prices. By using variables such as average income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and population, the notebook attempts to model the prices of houses and determine the key factors that influence them.

The analysis begins by importing necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. It then loads the housing dataset and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), including generating a correlation heatmap to visualize the relationships between different features. The features selected for analysis are:

Avg. Area Income
Avg. Area House Age
Avg. Area Number of Rooms
Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms
Area Population
The target variable is Price.

The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, preparing it for building predictive models that can estimate housing prices based on the provided features.

Library Imports:

Essential data analysis and visualization libraries are imported:
NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
%matplotlib inline is used to display plots directly in the notebook.
Data Loading:

The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv(). This dataset is expected to contain information such as average area income, house age, number of rooms, bedrooms, population, and housing prices.
Data Verification:

A heatmap is created using Seaborn to check the correlation between different variables. This helps to visually identify relationships between the predictors (e.g., income, house age, rooms) and the target variable (house prices).
The heatmap uses the correlation matrix (USAHousing.corr()) with annotations (annot=True) to display correlation coefficients directly on the plot, which is helpful in determining which variables have a stronger impact on housing prices.
Feature and Target Variable Selection:

The independent variables (features) selected for model training include:
Avg. Area Income
Avg. Area House Age
Avg. Area Number of Rooms
Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms
Area Population
The dependent variable (target) selected for prediction is the Price column, representing house prices.
Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library. This step ensures that the model can be evaluated on unseen data to check its performance. The dataset is divided into:
X: Features (Income, House Age, Rooms, Bedrooms, Population).
y: Target variable (Price).
Next Steps (Presumably):

After splitting the data, the next steps would likely involve training a machine learning model, such as a linear regression or other algorithms, to predict housing prices.
The notebook might also include metrics to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.
