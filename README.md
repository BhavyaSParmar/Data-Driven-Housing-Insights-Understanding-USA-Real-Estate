# 🏡 USA Housing Market Analysis

This project presents a data-driven exploration of the USA housing market, aimed at identifying key factors affecting house prices. Leveraging regression modeling and data visualization, the project builds a predictive framework and uncovers relationships between housing features and market value.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To analyze housing data and:

- 📈 Understand **feature impact** on home prices
- 🧮 Build a **predictive model** for house pricing
- 🔍 Perform **correlation and regression analysis**
- 🧊 Visualize key **housing trends**

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes real estate listings with attributes such as:

- **Avg Area Income**
- **Avg Area House Age**
- **Avg Area Number of Rooms**
- **Avg Area Number of Bedrooms**
- **Area Population**
- **Price** (Target Variable)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📈 Analytical Focus Areas

- Data distribution and outlier detection
- Correlation heatmaps and feature selection
- Regression modeling with training/testing split
- Evaluation using **R²**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- 💰 **Avg Area Income** and **Population** are strong predictors of house pricing.
- 🛏️ **Number of Bedrooms** showed **weak correlation** with price.
- 🔍 Linear regression produced an R² score of **~0.91**, indicating high model accuracy.
- 📉 Minimal overfitting observed due to appropriate train/test split and model tuning.
